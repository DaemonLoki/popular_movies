This is a project I had to submit for my Udacity Android Nanodegree.
It's basically some playing around with the API from themoviedb.com. 

Feel free to get inspired and more importantly provide feedback on structure and style. 
I'm more than happy to learn how to improve my code and app architecture.

PS: Java was a requirement, Kotlin was unfortunately not allowed. :)
